# Project Title: Unleashing Insights from Football Data Using Multiple Tools

## [Overview](#overview)
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of football data to uncover actionable insights for player performance, team comparison, attendance trends, and market value predictions. Leveraging advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques, this project aims to address key challenges and gaps in understanding player attributes, team dynamics, and competition factors. The analysis integrates statistical models, descriptive analytics, and visualizations to guide decision-making for stakeholders in the football domain.

## [Focus Areas and Key Tasks](#focus-areas-and-key-tasks)

1. **Performance Analysis**: Identified patterns in goal-scoring intervals, highlighting that most goals are scored in the final quarter (76-90 mins). Highlighted top-performing players like Christian Pulisic and Fabian Johnson, linking their high market value to performance metrics. Predicted player performance using logistic regression models.

2. **Player Profile and Market Value Prediction**: Conducted regression analysis to predict player market values based on performance metrics like goals and assists. Multi-linear regression provided better accuracy than single linear regression by accounting for complex relationships between features.

3. **Team Comparison**: Analyzed home and away team performance trends, confirming the home advantage in scoring goals. Discovered that 2012 saw the highest number of yellow and red cards drawn. Conducted team-wise and seasonal comparisons for goal-scoring patterns.

4. **Attendance and Stadium Analysis**: Identified declining attendance trends post-2016. Highlighted SIGNAL IDUNA PARK as the stadium hosting the highest number of matches with peak attendance. Classified stadium-related factors influencing audience turnout using KNN classification.

5. **Referee Analysis**: Dr. Felix Brych emerged as the referee officiating the highest number of matches (800+), with significant card decisions. Compared referees' tendencies in issuing yellow and red cards.

6. **Substitution Patterns**: Analyzed goal contributions from substitutes, with Aron Johannsson scoring the most goals as a substitute (24). Explored substitution trends over different seasons.

7. **Event Analysis**: Observed that substitutes played the most minutes in 2016 and had reduced time on the ground in 2020. Assessed the distribution of events like yellow cards, red cards, and substitutions across seasons.

8. **Competition Analysis**: Determined that domestic leagues had the highest goal-scoring rates compared to international competitions. Verified no significant correlation between yellow cards drawn and goals scored through hypothesis testing.

9. **Player Attributes and Demographics**: Clustered players based on height, market value, and age using K-means clustering. Visualized clusters with PCA for better interpretability. Found significant variance in market value distribution across player groups.

10. **Contract Management**: Identified that 2028 has the highest number of contract expirations for high-market-value players. Suggested monitoring player contracts closely for strategic decision-making.
